The React lane of the retired `development` plugin; its planning and phase-gated execution agents are gone, because a flow owns sequencing.

## Skills

- See [Copilot Skills](./copilot-skills.md) for skill inventory and provenance.

## Canvas Extensions

Canvas extensions add interactive UI panels the agent can open (`open_canvas`), rather
than skills/agents/instructions, but they are packaged and installed the same way as any
other local plugin — each one has its own `.github/plugin/plugin.json` with an
`"extensions"` field (instead of `"agents"`/`"skills"`) pointing at the folder containing
its `extension.mjs`. Install with `copilot plugin install`, same as any plugin in this
repo.

- `diagram-canvas` (`1.0.0`)
  - Source path: `plugins/copilot-app/extensions/diagram-canvas`
  - Install: `copilot plugin install JSdotNet/ai-plugins:plugins/copilot-app/extensions/diagram-canvas`
  - Canvas: `mermaid-diagram` (interactive C4/sequence/state/deployment/DDD/wireframe diagram viewer).
  - Used by: a flow skill (`delivery@jsdotnet`), which opens/updates this canvas on behalf of the `architecture`, `domain-design`, and `ux-design` agents it coordinates. Those content plugins have no direct dependency on this extension. Ships inside `copilot-app` but installs and runs independently.
- `markdown-canvas` (`1.0.0`)
  - Source path: `plugins/copilot-app/extensions/markdown-canvas`
  - Install: `copilot plugin install JSdotNet/ai-plugins:plugins/copilot-app/extensions/markdown-canvas`
  - Canvas: `markdown-preview` (live ADR/TDR/arc42/backlog document preview).
  - Used by: a flow skill (`delivery@jsdotnet`), which opens/updates this canvas on behalf of the `architecture`, `domain-design`, `ux-design`, `documentation`, and `product-owner` agents it coordinates. Those content plugins have no direct dependency on this extension. Ships inside `copilot-app` but installs and runs independently.
- `orch-dashboard` (`1`)
  - Source path: `plugins/copilot-app/extensions/orch-dashboard`
  - Install: `install_extension` tool with `https://github.com/JSdotNet/ai-plugins/tree/main/plugins/copilot-app/extensions/orch-dashboard` (not `copilot plugin install` — this extension has no standalone `.github/plugin/plugin.json`).
  - Canvas: live progress/output dashboard for a run reported through it — `copilot-app`'s `update-open-sessions`, or a flow from `delivery@jsdotnet` that resolved it as its surface.
  - Provider: orchestration agents should use the full plugin provider ID
    `plugin:copilot-app:orch-dashboard`; remove stale user-scope copies from
    `%USERPROFILE%\.copilot\extensions` if duplicate dashboard providers are reported.
  - Used by: `copilot-app` plugin only.

## Claude Code

The local plugin bundles also load in Claude Code, from a single copy of every file. Skills,
contracts and agents are shared as-is; only the manifest and the hook shape differ per host
(`.claude-plugin/`, `hooks/`), and both are hand-authored and checked:

```bash
node tools/check-assets.mjs
```

All bundles except `copilot-app` are Claude-targeted; that one depends on the Copilot CLI
canvas extension API, and its Claude sibling is the hand-authored `claude-desktop` bundle, which
replaces the canvases with an MCP server. See [Claude Code Compatibility](./docs/copilot/claude-code-compatibility.md)
for the translation rules, known differences, and install instructions.

## Update Process

1. Add or remove plugin entries in the table above.
2. Record a short note in the `Notes` column when changes are made.
3. Keep this file aligned with team onboarding docs.
4. Bump with `node tools/bump-version.mjs <plugin>` so both manifests, the marketplace entry,
   and the row here agree, and run `node tools/check-assets.mjs` before committing.
