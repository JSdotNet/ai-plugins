  Triage and fix a specific Aikido security finding.
  Use when: resolving a SAST vulnerability, removing a hardcoded secret,
  fixing an IaC misconfiguration, or triaging a non-code finding.

# Fix Security Issue

## Purpose

Retrieve an Aikido finding, classify whether it is code-fixable or requires a
non-code action, apply the appropriate remediation, and verify the fix with a
targeted re-scan.

## Issue Type Classification

| Code-fixable (fix in codebase) | Triage-only (advise and track) |
|---|---|
| `sast` | `open_source` (dependency upgrade) |
| `leaked_secret` | `cloud` |
| `iac` | `cloud_instance` |
| | `docker_container` |
| | `malware` |
| | `eol` |
| | `license` |
| | `mobile` |
| | `surface_monitoring` |
| | `scm_security` |
| | `ai_pentest` |

## Inputs

- Issue ID or description (required): the specific Aikido finding to address.
- Repo name (optional): used to filter `aikido_issues_list` if no issue ID is available.
- Accepted risk: `true` marks the finding as known/accepted without fixing (default: `false`).

## MCP Prerequisite

> If the Aikido MCP server (`aikido_issues_list`) is not available, stop immediately
> and tell the user to configure it using the setup instructions in `agents/aikido.agent.md`.

## Workflow

### Phase 1 — Retrieve the Finding

1. If an issue ID is provided, call `aikido_issues_list` filtered to that ID.
   Otherwise call `aikido_issues_list` with filters for `repo_name` and/or `severity`
   to locate the finding.
2. Display the finding details:
   - Title, type, severity, affected file/line (if applicable), and remediation guidance.
3. Confirm with the user which finding to address.

### Phase 2 — Classify

4. Determine the issue type:
   - **Code-fixable** → proceed to Phase 3.
   - **Triage-only** → proceed to Phase 4.

### Phase 3 — Apply Code Fix (code-fixable only)

5. Load the affected file(s) using `read/readFile`.
6. Analyse the vulnerable code section identified in the finding.
7. Apply the minimal targeted fix. Follow these rules:
   - Do not refactor unrelated code.
   - Do not introduce new functionality.
   - Do not change tests unrelated to the fix.
   - For `leaked_secret`: remove the credential, replace with an environment variable
     or secret manager reference, and provide rotation instructions.
   - For `sast`: apply the pattern recommended by the finding's remediation guidance.
   - For `iac`: update the configuration value or policy to the secure setting.
8. Re-scan the changed file(s):
   - For `sast` or `iac`: call `aikido_sast_scan` on the changed path.
   - For `leaked_secret`: call `aikido_secrets_scan` on the changed path.
9. Confirm the finding is no longer reported.
   - If the finding persists, analyse the re-scan output and iterate.
   - If the finding cannot be resolved, escalate to the user with a clear explanation.

### Phase 4 — Triage Non-Code Issues

10. For triage-only issues, do **not** attempt a code fix. Instead:
    - Explain the issue and its security impact.
    - Provide recommended remediation steps tailored to the issue type:
      - `open_source`: identify the vulnerable dependency and its fixed version.
      - `cloud` / `cloud_instance`: describe the misconfiguration and the remediation action in the cloud provider.
      - `docker_container`: describe the container vulnerability and the base image or layer to update.
      - `eol`: identify the end-of-life component and its supported replacement.
      - `license`: flag the incompatible license and suggest an alternative package.
      - `malware`: flag the affected dependency for immediate removal.
    - Ask whether to create a GitHub issue to track the finding.

### Phase 5 — Record and Close

11. For fixed issues:
    - Summarize the change made (file, line, what changed, why).
    - Confirm the re-scan result is clean.
    - Suggest committing with a message referencing the finding.

12. For triaged issues where a GitHub issue should be created:
    - Invoke the `aikido-issues-to-github` skill or create a GitHub issue directly.

## Output

- For code-fixable issues: diff of the applied fix, re-scan result confirming resolution.
- For triage-only issues: impact summary, remediation steps, and optional GitHub issue.

## Notes

- Never commit a fix that introduces a new Aikido finding.
- For `sast` fixes involving user input validation or cryptography, request a peer review.
- If a fix requires a significant refactoring, name `csharp-coding:coding` as its owner and
  say why; whether the work moves is the caller's decision.
