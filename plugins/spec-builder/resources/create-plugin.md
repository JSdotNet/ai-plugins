# Create Plugin Instructions

## Purpose

- Standardize plugin bundle composition so plugins stay installable and maintainable.
- Keep plugin assets modular and discoverable.

Over the 60-line budget by design: the Copilot CLI manifest contract below is reference the
author cannot look up in the repository.

## When To Apply

- Apply when a request asks to create or evolve a plugin package.
- Apply when a request combines multiple customization assets into one reusable capability.

## Required Plugin Composition Flow

1. Define plugin intent: name, target audience, and primary outcomes.
2. Define the asset set: which agents, skills, hooks, and MCP/LSP configurations are required.
3. Define the resource strategy: which reusable templates and checklists become resource files.
4. Define component paths: how `plugin.json` maps `agents`, `skills`, `hooks`, `mcpServers`.
5. Define maintenance metadata: ownership, update triggers, and semantic version notes.
6. Validate installability: `copilot plugin install <local-path>`, then `copilot plugin list`.

## Required Files

- `.github/plugin/plugin.json`
- `README.md` with install and usage notes
- Referenced component folders (`agents/`, `skills/`, and optional config assets)

## Mandatory Copilot CLI Requirements

- Place the manifest at `plugin.json`, `.plugin/plugin.json`, or `.github/plugin/plugin.json`.
- `plugin.json` requires `name` (kebab-case) and should carry `description`, `version`,
  `author`, `license`, and `keywords`.
- Declare component paths where used: `agents`, `skills`, `hooks`, `mcpServers`, `lspServers`,
  `commands`. Follow CLI defaults unless there is a strong reason to override.
- Reinstall local plugins after changes; the CLI caches plugin components.

## Recommended Asset Layout

- `plugins/<plugin-name>/.github/plugin/plugin.json`
- `plugins/<plugin-name>/agents/*.agent.md`
- `plugins/<plugin-name>/skills/<skill-name>/SKILL.md`
- Optional config: `hooks.json`, `.mcp.json`, `lsp.json`
- Optional overview page: `.github/plugins/<plugin-name>.md`

## Rules

- Use a kebab-case `name` and a semantic `version`.
- Keep the manifest description aligned with actual scope, and ensure every manifest path
  maps to an existing directory.
- Author both sides — `.github/plugin/plugin.json` with `hooks.json`, and
  `.claude-plugin/plugin.json` with `hooks/`, plus the repo-root marketplace entry and the
  `copilot-plugins.md` row. Nothing is generated; `node tools/check-assets.mjs` fails when
  the two sides or the four versions disagree. Full rules:
  [Crosscutting Concepts](../../../../.devbook/arc42/08-crosscutting-concepts.md).
- Follow [spec-conciseness.md](spec-conciseness.md) for pruning and
  the 60-line budget.

## Resource Rules

- Reference reusable resources by relative path from each consuming skill or agent instead of
  repeating guidance inline.
- Keep resources focused and single-purpose, and update them when process behavior changes.
- Keep examples realistic and free of secrets.

## Validation Checklist

- [ ] Plugin intent and scope are explicit, and README scope matches manifest scope.
- [ ] `plugin.json` is valid JSON with the required fields present.
- [ ] Component paths resolve to on-disk directories.
- [ ] Required assets are enumerated and linked.
- [ ] Agents and skills reference resources instead of duplicating content.
- [ ] Local install test was executed (`copilot plugin install <path>`).
- [ ] `node tools/check-assets.mjs` passes.
- [ ] Every line changes behavior versus the model default, and no meaning appears twice.
