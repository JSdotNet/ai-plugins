# Create Agent Skill

## Inputs

- Agent role, intent, and scope boundaries.
- Required tools and handoff expectations.

## Workflow

1. Review related agent and instruction files, and reuse their patterns.
2. Define role, priorities, constraints, and quality expectations.
3. Draft frontmatter with `name` matching the file name, plus `description`. Author `tools`
   as Copilot tool ids only, and record any model preference in a `## Model` body section
   rather than in frontmatter.
4. Draft the body: purpose first, then behavior, constraints, and references — adding each
   section only when the agent needs it.
5. Describe every handoff target in the body, since the `handoffs` key alone does not carry
   it to both hosts.
6. Prune against
   [spec-conciseness.md](../../resources/spec-conciseness.md):
   80-line body budget, no rule stated twice.
7. Append the Claude tool names `tools/tool-map.json` derives from the Copilot ids, list
   the agent under `agents` in the Claude manifest, then run `node tools/check-assets.mjs`
   to confirm the agent is valid for both hosts.

  `model`, `tools`, and `handoffs` are handled the way step 3 and step 5 require.
