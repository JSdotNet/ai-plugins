# Create Plugin Skill

## Inputs

- Plugin name, version, and scope.
- Required components (agents, skills, hooks, optional config).
- Packaging or install constraints.

## Workflow

1. Define plugin intent and boundaries.
2. Draft or update `.github/plugin/plugin.json`, and confirm every component path maps to an
   existing folder.
3. Update the plugin `README.md` with install and reinstall guidance.
4. Verify metadata and scope consistency across the manifest, README, and components.
5. Prune against
   [spec-conciseness.md](../../resources/spec-conciseness.md):
   state each rule once and point at its owner from everywhere else.
6. Write the Claude manifest, the Claude hook twin when there is a `sessionStart` prompt,
   the marketplace entry, and the `copilot-plugins.md` row, then run
   `node tools/check-assets.mjs` to confirm the plugin loads in both hosts.

## Output

- Updated plugin package metadata and Markdown documentation.
- Regenerated Claude manifest, hooks, and marketplace entry.
