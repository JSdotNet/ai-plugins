# Automation: Story Point Estimation

## Purpose

Run a batch story point estimation across all Fincent stories in a specified Jira status.
For each story, the automation checks DOR readiness, applies calibration from reference
stories, and delegates to the `story-point-estimation` skill to produce a reasoned
Fibonacci estimate.

## Jira Skill Discovery

Before executing any Jira operation, discover what Jira skills are available:

1. Check installed skills for skills whose name or description mentions "jira".
2. Identify a **query-capable** Jira skill — one that can search or list issues by status.
3. Identify a **retrieval-capable** Jira skill — one that can fetch a single existing issue.
4. Identify an **update-capable** Jira skill — one that can sync content back to an
   existing issue (including estimate fields).
5. If no query or retrieval skill is found: ask the user to paste story content for a
   single-story fallback run.
6. If no update skill is found and `update Jira` is enabled: skip write-back and note
   it in the output.

All Jira field mapping, project keys, and API conventions are owned by the discovered
Jira skill. Never reproduce that knowledge in this skill.

## Inputs

- **Jira status**: the status to query (e.g., `Ready for Refinement`, `Backlog`, `To Do`).
  All stories currently in this status are included in the run.
- **Skip estimated**: `true` (default) or `false` — skip stories that already have an
  estimate in Jira; still report drift when the new estimate differs.
- **Reference stories**: comma-separated list of Jira keys of previously estimated stories
  for calibration (optional).
- **Point scale**: `fibonacci` (default: 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21) or `t-shirt` (XS, S, M, L, XL).
- **Update Jira**: `true` or `false` (default) — write estimates back to Jira for stories
  that do not yet have one.

## Dependencies

| Dependency | Provided by | Purpose |
|-----------|-------------|---------|
| Story list | Discovered Jira query skill | All stories in the target status |
| Story content | Discovered Jira retrieval skill | Per-story estimation target |
| Reference stories | Discovered Jira retrieval skill | Calibration against historical velocity |
| Jira write-back | Discovered Jira update skill | Sync estimate and reasoning per story |
| Definition of Ready | `resources/dor.md` | Confirm story is ready before estimating |
| Story review checklist | `resources/templates/story-review-checklist.md` | Estimation section |

## Workflow

### Phase 1 — Story List and Shared Context

1. Run Jira Skill Discovery (see above).
2. Use the discovered query skill to retrieve all stories in the specified status.
   Let that skill own the query, filter, and pagination logic.
3. If reference stories were provided, use the retrieval skill to fetch them for
   calibration context.
4. Load `resources/dor.md` and `resources/templates/story-review-checklist.md` once.
5. Present the story count to the user and confirm before proceeding.

### Phase 2 — Per-Story Estimation (repeat for each story)

6. Use the discovered retrieval skill to fetch the full story content.
7. Run the DOR pre-check against `resources/dor.md`:
   - If critical DOR criteria are missing: flag as **not estimable**, record the gaps,
     and continue to the next story. Do not produce an estimate.

   > **Gate**: Only proceed to estimation if the story passed the DOR pre-check.

8. Check whether the story already has an estimate in Jira:
   - If an estimate exists and `skip estimated` is `true`: skip estimation for this story.
     Record the existing estimate for drift comparison if the skill is still run.
   - If no estimate exists: proceed to estimation.

9. Use the `story-point-estimation` skill with the loaded context to:
    - Score Complexity, Effort, and Uncertainty (each 1–5) with explicit reasoning.
    - Map the factor sum to an estimate on the configured scale.
    - Calibrate against reference stories if available.
    - Flag stories exceeding 12 hours / equivalent points for split discussion.
10. If `update Jira` is enabled and an update skill was discovered:
    - Only update if no estimate currently exists in Jira.
    - Use the discovered update skill to sync the estimate to Jira.

### Phase 3 — Consolidated Summary

12. Output a consolidated batch summary after all stories are processed:

    | Story | Title | DOR Ready | Current Points | New Estimate | Δ | Split Needed | Jira Updated |
    |-------|-------|-----------|---------------|--------------|---|-------------|-------------|
    | FIN-123 | — | ✅ | — | 5 | — | No | Yes |
    | FIN-124 | — | ✅ | 3 | 5 | +2 | No | No (existed) |
    | FIN-125 | — | ❌ | — | — | — | — | No (not ready) |

    - **Δ**: difference between the new estimate and the current Jira value; blank when no
      prior estimate. Highlight rows where `|Δ| > 2` for team review.
    - Stories not estimable due to DOR gaps are listed last with their gap summary.

## Output

- Per-story three-factor estimate with explicit reasoning.
- Split recommendations for stories exceeding the 12-hour DOR limit.
- Consolidated batch summary with drift column.
- Jira estimates updated for previously unestimated stories (if enabled and available).

## Notes

- Jira integrations, regulatory APIs, and cross-team dependencies are automatically
  treated as uncertainty boosters (minimum Uncertainty score: 3).
- Codebase inspection is not performed during estimation — that is reserved for the
  technical review (`story-review-dev`). Estimation is based on story content and
  reference stories only.
