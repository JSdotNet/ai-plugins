# ux-design

UX design — wireframes, design guidelines, user flows, and design reviews. Fills the `ux` role a flow consults, and is usable on its own.

## Usage

### Using the agent

Activate the `ux-designer` agent for all UX design work:

```
@ux-designer Create a mid-fidelity wireframe for the checkout screen.
@ux-designer Map the user flow for new user onboarding.
@ux-designer Create design guidelines for our web app.
@ux-designer Review the dashboard screen for UX issues.
```

### Using skills directly

Invoke a specific skill to start a guided workflow:

```
/ux-wireframe
/ux-design-review
/ux-design-guidelines
/ux-user-flow
```

## Skill Overview

| Skill | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `ux-wireframe` | Create low-, mid-, or high-fidelity wireframes as SVG or Mermaid |
| `ux-design-review` | Review screens or components against design guidelines and heuristics |
| `ux-design-guidelines` | Create or maintain a project design system or style guide |
| `ux-user-flow` | Map task flows, navigation trees, and user journey maps |

## Default Output Paths

| Artifact | Default Path |
|---|---|
| Design guidelines | `.devbook/design/` when the repository has it, else `docs/design/` |
| Wireframes | `docs/design/wireframes/` |
| User flows | `docs/design/flows/` |
| Design reviews | `docs/design/reviews/` |

The design folder is guideline-level only. Wireframes, flows, and reviews are artifacts produced from
those guidelines and never live there.

## Relationship to Other Plugins

- **architecture** — the `ux-designer` agent names `architecture:architect` for recording UX decisions as ADRs or carrying UX constraints into arc42 sections.
- **documentation** — it names `documentation:documentation` for wrapping design artifacts in How-To guides, Explanations, or Proposals.

Sequencing, approval, and delegation belong to whatever consults it.

## Optional Enhancement — impeccable

Install the `impeccable` skill from `awesome-copilot` to get deep frontend design and UI-craft guidance (by Paul Bakaus, impeccable.style):

```bash
copilot plugin install impeccable@awesome-copilot
```

When installed, the `ux-designer` agent and the `ux-design-review` and `ux-design-guidelines` skills will automatically invoke `/impeccable` for expert UI-craft input. Without it, the plugin falls back to its built-in design principles and wireframe pattern resources. Node 18+ on your PATH is required for impeccable's optional automation scripts.
