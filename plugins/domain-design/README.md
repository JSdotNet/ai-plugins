# domain-design

Domain-Driven Design: bounded contexts, ubiquitous language, domain models, and context maps. Fills the `domain` role a flow consults, and is usable on its own.

Writes to the repository's `.devbook/domain/` folder when it has one, following that folder's own structure and metadata rules; otherwise it follows `resources/domain-documentation-structure.md`.

## Relationship To Architecture Plugin

- This plugin owns domain design and modelling workflows.
- The `architecture` plugin owns arc42, ADRs, and TDRs.
- Install both when you need end-to-end coverage from domain discovery through architecture documentation.
- The `domain-architect` agent names `architecture:architect` as the handoff for recording decisions as ADRs or mapping results into arc42 sections. Sequencing, approval, and delegation belong to whatever consults it.
