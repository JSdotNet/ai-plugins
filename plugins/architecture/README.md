# architecture

Architecture documentation: arc42 sections, ADRs, TDRs, and the diagram set that belongs
inside them. Fills the `architecture` role a flow consults, and is usable on its own.

Architecture blueprints left this plugin: the devbook convention has no blueprint chapter,
and an arc42 document already carries what a blueprint did.

## Output

Writes to `.devbook/arc42/` when the repository has it — `NN-name.md` per section, one
decision record per concern under `adr/`, numbered and dated debt records under `tdr/`, each
folder with an index that sections 9 and 11 link to — following that folder's own structure
and metadata rules. Otherwise it asks for a path.

## Relationship To Other Plugins

- Self-contained: it declares no dependency and names no flow. Sequencing, approval, and
  delegation belong to whatever consults it.
- Hands off to `domain-design:domain-architect` for bounded contexts and ubiquitous
  language, `csharp-coding:coding` for implementation, and `ux-design:ux-designer` for
  design constraints that shape a section.
