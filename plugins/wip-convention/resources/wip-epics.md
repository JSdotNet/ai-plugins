# Epic Writing Instructions

## Purpose

- Apply these rules to epics stored in `.wip/work/*/epic-*.md`.
- Keep epics outcome-driven, concise, and easy to refine into sprint-sized stories.
- Keep structure compatible with issue trackers.

## Location and Naming

- Store epics in module folders under `.wip/work/`.
- Use one module depth only: `.wip/work/<module>/epic-<short-title>.md`.
- Keep epic files in the same module folder as related story and bug files.

## Core Quality Standard

- Epic describes a meaningful product outcome, not a technical task bucket.
- Epic has measurable value and clear boundaries.
- Epic is decomposable into independent stories.

## Required Structure (in order)

1. `# Epic: <Outcome title>`
2. `## Scope`
3. `## Risks and Dependencies`
4. `## Fields`
5. `## Notes`

## Optional Sections

Include these only when the information is known and adds value:

- `## Users and Stakeholders` — add when target audience needs explicit framing.
- `## Problem Statement` — add when the pain point needs explicit framing.
- `## Business Value` — add when urgency or ROI needs justification.
- `## Success Metrics` — add when measurable outcomes are defined.
- `## Story Breakdown` — add later, during refinement; not part of the initial epic.

## Section Rules

### Scope

- Include:
  - `In scope`
  - `Out of scope`
- Keep boundaries explicit to prevent uncontrolled growth.

### Risks and Dependencies

- Capture top delivery and adoption risks.
- Capture cross-team or external dependencies.

### Fields

- Keep fields compact and stable:
  - `Type: Epic`
  - `Priority: [TODO]`
  - `Labels: [TODO]`
  - `Owner: [TODO]`
  - `Target Release: [TODO]`

### Notes

- Add assumptions, open questions, and links to related stories.
- Keep bullets brief.

## Conciseness Rules

- Keep epic to roughly 1-2 screens.
- Use short paragraphs and one-line bullets when possible.
- Remove background that does not influence prioritization or delivery.

## Epic Template

```md
# Epic: <Outcome title>

## Scope

- In scope:
  - <item>
- Out of scope:
  - <item>

## Risks and Dependencies

- Risks:
  - <item>
- Dependencies:
  - <item>

## Fields

- Type: Epic
- Priority: [TODO]
- Labels: [TODO]
- Owner: [TODO]
- Target Release: [TODO]

## Notes

- Assumptions: <if any>
- Open questions: <if any>
- Related stories: <links or file names>
```

## Epic Readiness Check

- [ ] Outcome is clear and user-centered.
- [ ] Scope boundaries are explicit (in scope and out of scope).
- [ ] Risks and dependencies are visible.
- [ ] Optional sections are included only when the information is known.
