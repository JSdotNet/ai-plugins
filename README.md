# ai-plugins

The `jsdotnet-ai-plugins` plugin marketplace for Claude Code and GitHub Copilot: the specialist
agents, skills, and contracts that fill the roles a delivery flow consults — architecture,
coding, QA, domain, UX, documentation, product, security — plus two host plugins and the issue
trackers. Every asset is authored once and loaded by both hosts.

The flows themselves live elsewhere. Staged delivery, the pull-request lane, scheduled runs,
cross-session fan-out, and the knowledge-folder convention ship as `delivery`,
`delivery-schedule`, `fleet`, and `devbook` in the `jsdotnet` marketplace
([JSdotNet/ai-agent-stack](https://github.com/JSdotNet/ai-agent-stack)). A specialist here is
usable on its own and holds no flow control: it does not sequence stages, hold gates, spawn
sessions, or delegate.

## Install

### Claude Code

```bash
/plugin marketplace add JSdotNet/ai-plugins
```

Then `/plugin install <name>@jsdotnet-ai-plugins`. The marketplace name is a per-machine key
that every installed plugin references; it was `jsdotnet-copilot` until the repository
rename. A machine registered under the old name re-adds it and reinstalls:

```bash
/plugin marketplace remove jsdotnet-copilot
/plugin marketplace add JSdotNet/ai-plugins
```

### GitHub Copilot CLI

```bash
copilot plugin install JSdotNet/ai-plugins:plugins/architecture
```

`copilot plugin update architecture` refreshes an installed plugin and `copilot plugin list`
shows what is available.

### Host plugins

`claude-desktop` is the Claude side. In Claude Code it installs like any other plugin. In Claude
Desktop its dashboard renders inline in the conversation as an MCP App; build the bundle with
`pwsh ./scripts/Build-DesktopExtension.ps1`, which writes `dist/orch-dashboard-<version>.mcpb`.
Both paths are in [plugins/claude-desktop/README.md](plugins/claude-desktop/README.md).

`copilot-app` is the Copilot side. Its canvas extensions under `plugins/copilot-app/extensions/`
add side-panel surfaces a flow opens on behalf of the content plugins — `diagram-canvas`
(Mermaid), `markdown-canvas` (Markdown preview), and `orch-dashboard` (run progress). No content
plugin depends on them. `diagram-canvas` and `markdown-canvas` install on their own:

```bash
copilot plugin install JSdotNet/ai-plugins:plugins/copilot-app/extensions/diagram-canvas
```

`orch-dashboard` has no plugin manifest and installs through the app extension installer from
`https://github.com/JSdotNet/ai-plugins/tree/main/plugins/copilot-app/extensions/orch-dashboard`;
address it by the full provider id `plugin:copilot-app:orch-dashboard`, and if duplicate
providers are reported, remove stale user-scope copies from `%USERPROFILE%\.copilot\extensions`.

```

Inside a plugin, `agents/`, `skills/`, and `resources/` are shared by both hosts; the
manifests (`.github/plugin/plugin.json`, `.claude-plugin/plugin.json`) and the hooks
(`hooks.json`, `hooks/`) are one file per host, all hand-authored. No plugin ships an
`instructions/` folder — a file that must reach a session is a
`resources/` contract referenced by path, or a `sessionStart` hook. The full layout is in
[AGENTS.md](AGENTS.md).

## Dual-host model

One copy of every agent, skill, and contract serves both hosts, because each host ignores
the keys it does not know. There is no generator: every file is hand-authored, and
`node tools/check-assets.mjs` fails when the two hosts' files disagree. The rules that make
one copy possible — no `model` pins, one tools list with Copilot ids first and the Claude
names `tools/tool-map.json` derives from them, no host-specific tool names in prose, a
`sessionStart` prompt hook twinned by a Claude command hook plus sidecar — are in
[.devbook/arc42/08-crosscutting-concepts.md](.devbook/arc42/08-crosscutting-concepts.md).

## Working on the repository

1. Edit under `plugins/<name>/`; a change that touches one host's manifest or hooks touches
   the other's in the same commit.
2. Bump the version — both manifests, the marketplace entry, and the `copilot-plugins.md`
   row must agree:

   ```bash
   node tools/bump-version.mjs <plugin> [patch|minor|major]
   ```

3. Run both checks; neither writes anything:

   ```bash
   node tools/check-assets.mjs
   node .devbook/_tools/devbook-meta/build.mjs --check
   ```

   The first fails on a version that disagrees across the four places, on an agent shape a
   host rejects, on a Claude hook that drifted from its Copilot twin, on a rule whose wrappers
   drifted, and on a plugin with an `instructions/` folder. The second fails on a devbook
   chapter whose `meta` block or references do not resolve.
   `.github/workflows/check-assets.yml` and `.github/workflows/devbook-meta.yml` run them on
   pull requests.
4. Reinstall the plugin and exercise the agent or skill.
5. Update the `.devbook/` chapter the change makes untrue in the same pull request.
6. Commit one logical change per commit; leave nothing uncommitted.

Rules for the assets themselves — frontmatter, body budgets, tone, Markdown baseline — are the
eight topics under `.agents/rules/`, each wrapped once per host, beside the `devbook-*` rules
devbook installs; the convention is
[.agents/rules/README.md](.agents/rules/README.md). Read the matching
`plugins/spec-builder/resources/create-*.md` contract before authoring an asset of that type.
